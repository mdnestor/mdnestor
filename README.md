Hello, I am **Michael Nestor**. Here are some projects I have worked on:

- [PlexedPiper](https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/PlexedPiper), a proteomics data analysis package written in R
- [MSnID](https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/MSnID), mass spectrometry data library written in R
- [BeatAMLproteomics](https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/BeatAMLproteomics)
- [earlyLateAMLresistance](https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/earlyLateAMLresistance)
- [cytokineDrugResistance](https://github.com/PNNL-CompBio/cytokineDrugResistance)
- [MoTrPAC/motrpac-proteomics-pnnl-prototype](https://github.com/MoTrPAC/motrpac-proteomics-pnnl-prototype), data analysis pipeline for the MoTrPAC consortium
- [DL-Batch-Correction](https://github.com/PNNL-Comp-Mass-Spec/DL-Batch-Correction), variational autoencoders and generative adversarial networks for batch correction of proteomics data, written in Python using PyTorch. Abandoned
 
Fun stuff:
  - [lean-scripts](https://github.com/mdnestor/lean-scripts), a collection of mathematical definitions and theorems written in Lean 4.
  - [voxeltorus](https://github.com/mdnestor/voxeltorus), raycasting voxel engine written in Rust.
  - [eloworld](https://github.com/mdnestor/eloworld), collection of (bad) chess algorithms
